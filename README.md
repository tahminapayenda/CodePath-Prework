## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Clarity (A mental health App)
- It has a feature called insights where it generates insights from the regularly daily journaling you do on the app as you check in and answer some questions. The questions basically make sure you start your day positively and helps you reframe your negative thoughts. The insights feature is a great way to look back at your previous journal writings as it generates personalized stats from that for the user. 
- Under discover, there is an assessment section that is pretty cool. It is comprised of quizzes that assess some common mental health concerns such as procrastination assessment, mindfulness test and more. 

2. Instagram
- I like the notes feature on instagram that let's the users share a small note with their followers.
- I like an instagram user can hide the number of likes on posts.
- Unsend message functionality

3. Slack
- Having public and private channels seperately for a workspace 
- Having a canva/document for each channel

4. Google Calender
- The ability to create multiple calenders within the same app
- The color and label functionality for events


An App Idea: 

I am thinking of creating an application that can automatically filter and recommend opportunities, programs and extra-curriculars that are fully remote and are free or low cost that can be used for Afghan women and girls specifically and anybody else in general. I haven't fully thought of its features but definitely filtering for specific majors/areas of interest and personalized experience that lets the users save and share the opporutnities they like. I am also thinking of having a chat feature to connect with other people who are also looking for similar opportunites. 

## Notes

I just had a bit of difficulty using the swift IDE and navigating it.
